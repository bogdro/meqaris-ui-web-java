This is the README file for Meqaris Web User Interface.

Meqaris (Meeting Equipment and Room Invitation System) is a system that
 allows booking meeting rooms and other resources (like mobile whiteboards,
 projectors or conference sets) using the same e-mail invitations that
 are used to invite participants to meetings.

Meqaris Web User Interface allows to:
- view Meqaris configuration,
- view meeting resources, like rooms or equipment,
- view all resource reservations (current and past).

Requirements:

- A Java Runtime Environment (JRE)
